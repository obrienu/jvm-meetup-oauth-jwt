## JVM community August meetup talk by Odohi David.


## TOPIC:
  Using JWT for authentication in spring boot RESTFUL API


## ABSTRACT: 
  In the session we would discuss how to implement authentication in a spring boot
  rest api, by leveraging spring security and customizing it. We would not discuss
  how to create a spring boot app, but we will discuss how the spring security works
  and why we would want to use JWT authentication.

  Due to time, there would not be live coding, but already written example code would be used to explain.

### Target audience:
  Intermediate to advanced.
